# United Nations Security Council Consolidated List

https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/un-sc-consolidated-list

The Consolidated List includes all individuals and entities subject to measures imposed by the Security Council. The inclusion of all names on one Consolidated List is to facilitate the implementation of the measures, and neither implies that all names are listed under one regime, nor that the criteria for listing specific names are the same. For each instance where the Security Council has decided to impose measures in response to a threat, a Security Council Committee manages the sanctions regime. Each sanctions committee established by the United Nations Security Council therefore publishes the names of individuals and entities listed in relation to that committee as well as information concerning the specific measures that apply to each listed name.

#  Consolidated Screening List API (International Trade Administration)

https://internationaltradeadministration.github.io/developerportal/consolidated-screening-list.html

The Consolidated Screening List API consolidates export screening lists of the Departments of Commerce, State and the Treasury into a single data feed as an aid to industry in conducting electronic screens of potential parties to regulated transactions.

In the event that a company, entity or person on the list appears to match a party potentially involved in an export transaction, additional due diligence should be conducted before proceeding. There may be a strict export prohibition, requirement for seeking a license application, evaluation of the end-use or user to ensure it does not result in an activity prohibited by any U.S. export regulations, or other restriction. For more information view the informational video from the National Customs Brokers.

The API only contains active entities on the list. For historical research, please reference the sources directly.

The output format for this API is JSON. This data set is updated hourly.
